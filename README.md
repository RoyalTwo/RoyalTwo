### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an intermediate programmer currently. My main languages are C#, Python, and Java.

I'm also trying to learn more about web development, though I love new languages.
Trying to fix my issue of having no idea where to go!
There isn't much here right now, so feel free to check back later!

### <ins>My Current Tasks</ins> ###
  - Become more adept with Python.
  - Work more with APIs and libraries.
  - Work on the feeling of being lost.
  - Learn Kotlin.
  - Learn Dart and Flutter.
  - Get started with Web Development!

Have a good day!

### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I like programming and engineering in general. I love tech! 

> Currently working on learning more low level concepts and implementations, like operating systems, shaders, or game engines!

I love learning new things and building projects, especially both at the same time!

### <ins>Current Goals</ins> ###
  - Eris rewrite
  - Compiler
  - Server manager

I'm not very good at ending things so.... have a good day? Yeah, have a good day!

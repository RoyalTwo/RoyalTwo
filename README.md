### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an intermediate programmer at the moment. My main languages are C# and Java.

Specifically, I'm focused on *Minecraft* modding at the moment!
There isn't much here at the moment, so feel free to check back later!

### <ins>My Current Tasks</ins> ###
  - Become more adept with Java.
  - Work more with APIs and libraries.
  - Learn Kotlin.

Have a good day!

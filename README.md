### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a beginner programmer currently! My main programming languages right now are JS and Python, but I hope to learn C++ soon as well ðŸ˜Š

I'm also trying to learn more about computer science in general, so I have a greater understanding of underlying systems (and hopefully feel more confident :D)<br>
Trying to fix my issue of having no idea where to go! <br>

There isn't much here right now, but feel free to check back later! (If you would want to, for some reason! I don't judge!)

### <ins>My Current Tasks</ins> ###
  - Finish TheOdinProject course
  - Work more with libraries and frameworks rather than standalone
  - Overcome the feeling of being lost...
  - Learn Kotlin!
  - Learn C++ and potentially C, to help with my understanding of underlying systems!
  - Make some *Minecraft* mods potentially?

I'm not very good at ending things so.... have a good day? Yeah, have a good day!!!

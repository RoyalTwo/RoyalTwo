### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a beginner programmer currently! My main programming languages right now are JS and Python, but I hope to learn C++ soon as well ðŸ˜Š

I'm also trying to learn more about computer science in general, so I have a greater understanding of underlying systems (and hopefully feel more confident :D)<br>
Working on knowing where to start with projects! <br>

There isn't much here right now, but feel free to check back later! (If you would want to, for some reason! I don't judge!)

### <ins>Current Goals</ins> ###
  - Learn more about back-end development
  - Update RTIW Bot
  - "Finish" Eris (if it ever will be)
  - Overcome the feeling of being lost
  - Learn Kotlin/Java, and apply to creating *Minecraft* mods potentially
  - Learn C++ and potentially C, to help with my understanding of underlying systems!

I'm not very good at ending things so.... have a good day? Yeah, have a good day!!

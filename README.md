### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

At the moment I primarily use JavaScript, but I'm interested in and have used other languages like C, C#, etc.

> Currently working on learning more low level concepts and implementations, like operating systems, shaders, or game engines!

I love learning new things and building projects, especially both at the same time!

### <ins>Current Goals</ins> ###
  - Eris (messaging app) rewrite
  - Learning low level concepts
  - Adding on to RTIW and ShameBot
  - Finish more projects

I'm not very good at ending things so.... have a good day? Yeah, have a good day!

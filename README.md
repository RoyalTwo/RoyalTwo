### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

At the moment I primarily use JavaScript, but I'm also in the process of learning Go and C++. ðŸ˜Š

I'm also trying to learn more about computer science in general, so I have a greater understanding of underlying systems :D

### <ins>Current Goals</ins> ###
  - Work on v2 of Eris (messaging app)
  - Become proficient in Go/C++
  - Try making small games as well

I'm not very good at ending things so.... have a good day? Yeah, have a good day!!
